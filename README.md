Hey there, I'm `DarshK35`

I do a lot of things, coding, playing music, playing games, draw.........
Here you will find some of the projects I have and am working on. Sure, most of them are incomplete, but is there any truly complete project?

You can check these repos:

- [A Pong Game I made while learning Unity](https://github.com/DarshK35/DPong)
- [A fun web project](https://github.com/DarshK35/CV-Project)
- [A long term project - card game](https://github.com/DarshK35/Kalashnikov-Card-Game)
